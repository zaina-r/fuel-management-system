# Fuel Pass - Fuel Management Sysytem
This project is a fuel management system that was developed to simplify and enhance the process of fuel allocation and usage tracking. This system is designed to streamline fuel distribution by integrating vehicle registration, QR code-based tracking, and station management. Vehicles are assigned weekly fuel quotas, and stations use an app to scan QR codes, log fuel transactions, and update quotas in real time. An admin panel ensures that all transactions and registrations are monitored and approved as necessary.
## Features
### Vehicle Owners
- **Register their vehicles**: Each user that is registered as a vehicle owner can register any number of vehicles, using their basic details and their vehicle chassis number, which will generate a QR code unique to each vehicle
- **Download QR code**: Vehicle owners can download the QR code for their vehicles any number of times, by accessing their vehicle details
- **View vehicle details**: Owners have the option to view the vehicle details as registered, along with the available fuel quota
### Fuel Station Owners
- **Register Fuel Stations**: Register their fuel stations using their Licence IDs
- **Access the QR scanning mobile-app**: Only registered stations can log in to the QR scanner mobile-app, using a code regenerated every day
